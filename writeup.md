# Bounty Custom Component - Calculator

As part of the bounty project, I created a MyCustomWidget file which renders a calculator component. From a previous quest, I have learnt how to build a calculator using react. Using that knowledge, I have created this calculator for the submission. It is also a utility component which is much needed for a planner web app as there are many situations in which a calculator is necessary, for example, **calulating expenses, taxes,etc.**

The calculator works like a conventional calculator with buttons to insert numbers and a display which shows which button was clicked, normal operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are possible using the appropriate buttons with the usual symbols. An all clear button and a sign changing button is also included.
All of the operations can be performed by clicking on the buttons. "=" button gives the answer of the current expression on the display.

The calculator widget is small in size so that it can fit on left, right or center of the web page. Additional code has been added to App.css for styling the calculator component. A components folder with a Button.js file handles the logic of the calculator component. 

Changes have been made to WidgetGalleryModal.js and App.js to add this new custom widget to the web app.
